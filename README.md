# Axolotl
Axolotl provides a set ofÂ volumetric modelling components for Rhino Grasshopper. They come as GH user objects and most of them are Python scripts. The range of possible applications is quite broad, it can do a lot of things. It is not fast! It is thought and used as a teaching resource.

Axolotl is continuously being developed at Digital Building Technologies DBT / ETH Zurich as a [project](http://dbt.arch.ethz.ch/project/axolotl/), part of a [research stream](http://dbt.arch.ethz.ch/research-stream/volumetric-modelling/).

More about the research on volumetric modelling can be found here:

## Keywords
signed distance fields (SDF), voxel, function representation (FRep), constructive solid geometry (CSG), implicit surfaces, lattice generation

## Installation
Copy the content of the folder [UserObjects](UserObjects) into the corresponding special folder of your Grasshopper installation (Grasshopper: *File > Special Folders > User Object Folder*). You should then see a new tab `Axolotl2` appear in the GH toolbar, containing the Axolotl components.
As most of the user objects are Python scripting components, you will also need to install GHPython plugin from here: [food4rhino.com/app/ghpython](http://www.food4rhino.com/app/ghpython)

## What people say
- "Kind of confusing/sloppy plug-in, the description sounded cool but seems little half baked." *(Ben Finkle)*
- "MAN THIS IS INCREDIBLE" *(Marco Angrisani)*
- "I find this really cool!" *(Giulio Piacentino, McNeel)*
