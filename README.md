# Axolotl
Axolotl provides a small but growing set ofÂ volumetric modeling components for Rhino Grasshopper. They come as GH user objects and most of them are Python scripts.

## Keywords
signed distance fields (SDF), voxel, function representation (FRep), constructive solid geometry (CSG), implicit surfaces, lattice generation

## Installation
Copy the content of the folder `UserObjects` into the corresponding special folder of your Grasshopper installation. You should then see these icons appear in the `User` tab.

## Background
More about the research on volumetric modeling can be found here:
[dbt.arch.ethz.ch/research-stream/volumetric-modelling/](http://dbt.arch.ethz.ch/research-stream/volumetric-modelling/)

## Future
The idea is that this becomes a proper GH plugin one day. The (preliminary) project name is **Axolotl**.
